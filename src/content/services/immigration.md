# Primary Care

Lorem ipsum dolor.

# I-693 Physical

As a primary care physician and USCIS designated civil surgeon, we have extensive experience in I-693 applications. Our clinic can be your one-stop destination for all the vaccines required to complete your I-693 form for both parents and children. There's no need to make that extra trip to the health department or other medical offices to complete your vaccine requirements. We will accomodate your interview timeline and offer **1 day** visits for clients who are pressed for time.

## Competitive Pricing

Call our front desk at (919) 363-3427 for free consultation. We provide competitive prices for medical exams and form preparation. Some may have charges from reference laboratories for required laboratory tests if their insurance does not cover it.

## Turnaround Time

Depending on your vaccination records and test results, it normally takes **1-3 business days** before your paperwork is ready. This is usually done over the course of 2 visits. If you are pressed for time, it can be arranged in 1 visit as well, but please let us know ahead of time.
